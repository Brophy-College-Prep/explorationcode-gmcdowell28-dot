CFU:

1) What’s the difference between a class selector and an id selector in CSS?
A class can be used multiple times on a page, but an id should only be used once.

2) Why does li a style the links but li doesn’t change the text color?
Because the text is inside the anchor (<a>) tag, not the <li>.

3) What does text-transform: uppercase; do to text?
It makes all letters capitalized.

4) What does background-attachment: fixed; do in the parallax sections?
It keeps the background image fixed while the page scrolls.

5) If your background images don’t show up, list two reasons why.
The file path could be wrong, or the image file name could be incorrect.
